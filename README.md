# learn_flask_2
The purpose of this repository is to save my progress in learning Flask in more detail. This is a basic Flask app that displays blog posts and has registration and login pages.

Run `python3 run.py` after installing requirements.

I followed the Flask tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH).
